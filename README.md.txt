# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using statistical summaries and visualizations
- Standardized features using StandardScaler
- Trained and evaluated KNN and Logistic Regression models
- Compared model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Saved trained model and scaler using Joblib
- Tested model with real-time input samples

## Results
- Achieved 100% accuracy on test dataset
- Logistic Regression selected as final model
- Successfully predicted new flower species inputs

## Future Improvements
- Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit
- Add cross-validation
- Implement hyperparameter tuning
